# Devise::Stalkable

Stalkable is a gem that tracks logins of each user. Based on [devise-login_tracker](https://github.com/blueberryapps/devise-login_tracker)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'devise-stalkable'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

Run the generator with the model name (User in this example):

    $ rails g devise_stalkable User

Add `:stalkable` to `devise` in your model and association
to the login records. Example for User model:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  devise :database_authenticatable, ..... , :stalkable

  has_many :logins, class_name: 'UserLogin'
end
```

**Note: there is currently a bug in the YAML generation. Be sure to empty the users_login.yml file before running any tests**

## What is being tracked

For each login new record is created with following attributes:

* `ip_address` - IP address
* `user_agent` - User agent
* `signed_in_at` - Signed in at
* `last_seen_at` - Last seen at (on new requests)
* `signed_in_at` -  Signed out at (upon sign out)
